1. Javascript is a High Level, Object Oriented, Multi Paradigm programming language.
    High Level : Don't have to worry about low level memory management.
    Object Oriented : Uses the concepts of classes and objects.
    Multi Paradigm : Different styles of programming can be used (Like Imperative and Declarative).

2. Use camel casing for variable declaration. Variables cannot begin with a number. Variables can only contain
    alphabets, numbers, underscore and dollar($) sign. Cannot use reserved Javascript keywords to name variables(name is the 
    only exception, it can be used as a variable, but still should be avoided).

3. Use capitalized variable names for classes (class Person) and uppercase variable names for mathematical constants 
    (e.g. PI = 3.1415). Variables should be very descriptive.

4. There are 7 types of primitive data types.
    1. Number : Floating point numbers. Used for decimal and integers.
    2. Strings : Sequence of characters. Used for text.
    3. Boolean : True oor False.
    4. Undefined : Value taken by a variable that is not yet defined. (empty value)
    5. Null : Also means empty values but used in different curcumstances.
    6. Symbol : Value that is unique and cannot be changed.
    7. BigInt : Larger integers than the number type can hold.

    Javascript has dynamic typing. We do not have to manually define data types for variables.
    typeof undefined variable is also undefined.
    typeof null is an object. (This is a bug in Javascript).

5. let and const were introduced in es6, var is old javascript.
   let can be reassigned. (Mutable variable)
   const is used for variables that are not supposed to change at any point in the future. (Immutable variable)
   Since const variables are immutable, empty const variables cannot be declared.

6. 2 ** 3 is 2 to the power 3 which is exponentiation operator.

7. `${} hello etc` way of formatting strings is called a template literal. 
    When you need to create a multiline string just do this:

    const str = `This is
    a multiline
    string.`

8. '1771' + 10 will give us 177110. NaN means not a number or an invalid number.
    Use Number(x) to convert x to number.
    Use String(x) to convert x to string.
    Type conversion is the process of changing datatype of a variable manually.
    Type coercion is where javascript itself changes the datatype of a variable in order for an expression to 
    evaluate successfully.

9. There are 5 falsy values : null, undefined, '', 0, NaN. They become false when converted to boolean.

10.
    === is Strict equality operator and == is loose equality operator.
    === does not perform type coercion. == performs type coercion.
    != and !== are the not equal variants.

11. if(23 > 11) {  This is a statement
        const str = '23 is greater than 11';
    }

    23 > 11 This is an expression
    a && b || c This is also an expression
