Advanced DOM and Events

1. DOM tree is generated from an HTML document which we can interact with. DOM is very complex API that contains
    a lot of methods and properties to interact with the DOM tree.

    Use document.documentElement to select the entire page. Similarly use doucument.head and document.body
    to select head and body tags.

    There are a few methods for selecting elements
    1. document.querySelector('.className') or document.querySelector('#idName')
    2. document.querySelectorAll('.className')
    3. document.getElementById('idName')
    4. document.getElementsByClassName('className')
    5. document.getElementsByTagName('tagName')

    Create Element 
    const message = document.createElement('div'); Creates a div and stores it inside message.
    This element can only exist in dom at one place.

    Attach element wrt another element
    header.prepend(message)
    header.append(message)
    header.addAjacentHTML('afterbegin', message);

    Delete Element
    message.remove();

2. To add a style to an element do:
    element.style.backgroundColor = 'orangered';
    element.style.fontSize = '14px';
    
    To read attributes like src or alt from an image do:
    const imgElement = docuement.querySelector('.src');
    console.log(imgElement.src);
    console.log(imgElement.alt);

    We can also change the attributes like this:
    imgElement.alt = "New alt text!";

    To set and get non standard attributes 
    imgElement.setAttribute('company', 'bankist');
    console.log(imgElement.getAttribute('company'));

    Work with the classes using these methods

    logo.classList.add('c', 'j');
    logo.classList.remove('c', 'j');
    logo.classList.contains('c');
    logo.classList.toggle('c');

3. Use element.getBoundingClientRect() to get the coordinates of the target element.

    To scroll to a certain element in the DOM simply do
    section1.scrollIntoView({behvaiour : 'smooth'});
    which is the modern solution.

4. An event is a signal trigerred by a DOM node. 
    const callback = () => {}
    h1.addEventListener('click', () => callback)
    This function is used to add an event listener.

    h1.removeEventListener('click', () => callback)
    This function is used to remove event listener. However the callback function must be the same one that was
    used during add.

    Event propagation in javascript
    1. Capturing Phase : The event is not generated at the target element but instead is generated at the root
    of the DOM tree which is the document. The event travels down from the root to the source where it was
    originated. This is the capturing phase.

    2. Target Phase : The event reaches the target element where the event occured and the callback function
    executes.

    3. Bubbling Phase : The event bubbles up to the root of the DOM tree back to the document.

    Some elements only have the target phase. They don't have capturing or bubbling phase but they are rare.

    e.target is the element where the event originated.
    e.currentTarget is the element to which the event listener is attached to which is same as this keyword. 
    e.stopPropagation() is used to stop upwards propagation.

    Set the third parameter to true in addEventListener inorder to detect events in capturing phase.

5. Event Delegation is the way of optimising addition of the event listeners to inidividual elements by adding 
    the listener to a common parent element. When the event bubbles up, we can check which element originated
    the event.

6. querySelector() and querySelectorAll() can work on both document and other elements too. If these functions
    are called on an element they would select all descendants of that element with the particular attribute.
    Use el.childNodes to get all nodes of all types for the el.
    Use el.children to get only element children
    Use el.firstElementChild to get the first child element and el.lastElementChild to get the last child element 
    inside the children list.

    Use el.parentNode and el.parentElement to get the parent node or parent element for the el.
    Use el.closest('.header') Find the closest parent of el with header class

    Javascript allows you to only select direct next and direct previous sibling
    el.nextElementSibling and el.previousElementSibling to select next or previous element.
    el.parentElement.children to select all children element.

7. mouseenter does not bubble up but mouseover does.
    Scroll event is not very efficient since it fires everytime user scrolls.
    Use intersection observer to implement sticky header or reveal new sections of website when they are
    scrolled into view.

    Lazy Loading:
    Lazy Loading is a technique used with images where a lower resolution version of the image is displayed
    but when the image is brought into view then the higher resolution version is loaded.

    Use defer keyword when adding script tag inside HTML because it makes sure everything gets executed in order.
